		<h4>Thomas Jefferson</h4>
		<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
		that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, 
		Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, 
		deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, 
		it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, 
		as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; 
		and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
		But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, 
		and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these </p>
		
		<h4>Abraham Lincoln</h4>
		<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent,
		a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, 
		can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. 
		It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. </p>
