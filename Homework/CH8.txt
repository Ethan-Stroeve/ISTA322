1) the three requirments as the author describes are
	• Enhance the Index action method in the HomeController class so that it can filter the Product objects in the
	 repository
	• Revisit and enhance the URL scheme
	• Create a category list that will go into the sidebar of the site, highlighting the current category and linking to
	 others
	 
2) when adding new routes you should add them in the order that you want them applied because routes are 
applied in the order in which they are defined, and you will get some odd effects if you change the order.

3) Yes, ASP.NET Core 3 handles both outgoing and incoming HTTP requests, this is imprortant for url consistency.

4) view components are perfect for creating items such as reusable navigation controls. A view component is a C# class
that provides a small amount of reusable application logic with the ability to select and display Razor partial views.
we use view components to render things like a navigation menu.

5) when you use a view component in a view you reference the component by using the invoke method, they are also applied
with a tag helper.

6) When ASP.NET Core needs to create an instance of the view component class, it will note the need to provide a value
for this parameter and inspect the configuration in the Startup class to determine which implementation object should
be used.

7)ASP.NET can get a users current infromation with a get request.

8) The PathAndQuery extension method operates on the HttpRequest class, which ASP.NET Core uses to describe an HTTP
request. The extension method generates a URL that the browser will be returned to after the cart has been updated, taking into
account the query string, if there is one.

9) session state is data associated with a series of requests made by a user.

10) session state feature in ASP.NET Core stores only int, string, and byte[] values. Yes you can store a type that is 
not supported by using an interface.
