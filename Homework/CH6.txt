1) unit testing is a form of testing in which individual components are isolated from the rest of the application so
their behavior can be thoroughly validated.

2) dotnet new xunit -o SimpleApp.Tests --framework netcoreapp3.1
dotnet sln add SimpleApp.Tests
dotnet add SimpleApp.Tests reference SimpleApp

3) three unit test project tools are mstest, nunit, xunit.

4) the convention for naming unit tests is <ApplicationName>.Tests

5) the convention for naming test classes is to describe what is being tested, for methods it is to describe
what the test does.

6) the fact attribute is applied to each method to indicate that it is a test.  
the theory attribute denotes a parameterised test that is true for a subset of data.

7) The AAA testing pattern stands for arrange, act, assert. Arrange refers to setting up conditions for the test,
act refers to performing the test, assert refers to verifying that the result is the expected one.

8) The methods in the Assert class are used to check the outcome of an action is the one expected. The purpose of
Assert.Equals is to ensure the result is equal to what is expected, it has 2 parameters (expected. result) but there
is a version that accepts a third parameter when dealing with interfaces. Returns a exception if the two object are 
not equal.

9) The key to isolating a component for testing is interfaces.

10) A mocking package makes it easy to create fake or mock objects for testing.

11) Setup() can be used for mocking a method or a property.
SetupGet() is specifically for mocking the getter of a property.
